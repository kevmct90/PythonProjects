# Python has a number of string functions which are in the string library
# These functions are already built into every string - we invoke them by appending the function to the string variable
# These functions do not modify the original string, instead they return a new string that has been altered

greet = "Hello Bob"
zap = greet.lower()
print zap
# hello bob

print greet
# Hello Bob

print "Hi There". lower()
# hi there
