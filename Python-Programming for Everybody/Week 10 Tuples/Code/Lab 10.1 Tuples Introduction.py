# TUPLES INTRODUCTION


# Tuples are another kind of sequence that functions much like a list - they have elements which are indexed
# starting at 0

# key, way to identify a tuple is the round parenthesis.
x = ('Glenn', 'Sally', 'Joseph')
print x[2]      # Joseph

y = (1, 9, 2)
print y     # (1, 9, 2)

print max(y), "max"     # 9 max

for v in y:
    print v
# 1
# 9
# 2
