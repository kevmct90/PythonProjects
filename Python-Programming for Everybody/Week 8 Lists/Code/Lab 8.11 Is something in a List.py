# Python provides two operators that let you check if an item is in a list
something = range(1, 9)
print something     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

print 9 in something        # False

print 8 in something        # True

print 20 not in something   # True

# These are logical operators that return True or False
# They do not modify the list
